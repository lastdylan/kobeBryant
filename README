Here I am exploring data from the Kobe Bryant kaggle competition. The data 
contains information on every shot that Kobe threw since he started in the 
NBA. Some of the shots do not have information on whether he made the shot 
or not; we use these as test data and the rest as training data. 

See https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection for a more complete 
description of the problem. 

I am using numpy scipy and pandas
as the main tools. This is work in progress
